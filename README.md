# E-Comm Platform Architecture Overview

This document outlines a reference architecture for a full-stack e-commerce
application that supports customer sign-up and purchasing flows, cart
management, order processing, payments, and real-time order status updates.

## High-Level User Journey

1. **Account creation / login** – The client application collects user
   credentials and calls the authentication API, which issues a JSON Web Token
   (JWT) plus a refresh token.
2. **Browsing products** – The frontend retrieves paginated product catalog
   data through the product APIs backed by the database.
3. **Cart management** – Users add or remove items; the cart APIs persist the
   state server-side to support multi-session experiences.
4. **Checkout** – The client posts the cart snapshot to the payment checkout
   endpoint, which talks to Stripe or PayPal to create a payment session.
5. **Order creation** – After successful payment confirmation (via webhook),
   the order is saved with an initial status of `Pending`.
6. **Order fulfillment** – Admin staff update order statuses (e.g., `Processing`,
   `Shipped`, `Delivered`).
7. **Real-time updates** – Customers receive live updates when order statuses
   change through WebSockets or a server-sent events (SSE) channel subscribed to
   order updates.

## Suggested Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React or Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a state
  management library such as Redux Toolkit or TanStack Query.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or NestJS, leveraging TypeScript for
  consistency.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational) or MongoDB (document). PostgreSQL is
  preferred for transactional consistency; MongoDB works well when product data
  is highly variable.
- **Authentication:** JWT access tokens plus refresh tokens stored securely
  (e.g., HTTP-only cookies). Consider integrating with OAuth providers for
  social logins.
- **Payments:** Stripe or PayPal SDKs; implement webhooks to reconcile payment
  state and prevent tampering.
- **Real-time Layer:** Socket.IO (WebSockets) or SSE channel hosted by the
  backend, optionally backed by Redis Pub/Sub for horizontal scaling.
- **Infrastructure:** Deploy backend on containerized workloads (Docker +
  Kubernetes or serverless functions). Use a CDN plus edge cache for the
  frontend. Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Service Boundaries and Data Flow

```

* The **Auth API** handles registration, login, profile management, and issues
  JWTs. Refresh tokens are persisted server-side or in secure storage to enable
  token rotation and revocation.
* The **Product API** provides catalog data, supports search and filtering, and
  enforces admin-only access for creation, updates, and deletion.
* The **Cart API** allows users to maintain persistent carts. Implement locking
  or optimistic concurrency to avoid race conditions when the same cart is
  modified simultaneously.
* The **Order API** is responsible for order creation, retrieval, and admin
  status updates. Orders enter a `Pending` state until payment confirmation
  arrives.
* The **Payment API** initiates checkout sessions and listens for payment
  gateway webhooks to mark payments as complete. On successful payment, it
  triggers order creation and status transitions.
* The **Real-time Hub** pushes order status updates to clients. When an admin
  updates an order, the backend publishes an event that the hub broadcasts to
  the subscribed user channel.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security:** Enforce HTTPS, validate all inputs, and implement rate-limiting
  on sensitive endpoints. Use role-based access control for admin functions.
- **Observability:** Collect logs, metrics, and traces (e.g., via OpenTelemetry)
  for each service. Monitor key KPIs such as conversion rate, payment failures,
  and order fulfillment time.
- **Scalability:** Cache product listings via Redis or CDN edge caching.
  Separate read/write database replicas as traffic grows. Use message queues
  (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) to decouple order fulfillment workflows.
- **Testing:** Automate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for critical
  flows—authentication, cart operations, checkout, and webhook handling.
- **Compliance:** Follow PCI-DSS guidelines by offloading card handling to the
  payment gateway, and ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for user data.

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can be iterated on as the
business grows, supporting both customer-facing features and operational
efficiency for administrators.
